### Control Cycle Consulting presents our submission to the [2024 SOA Research Challenge](https://www.soa.org/research/opportunities/2024-student-research-case-study-challenge/)

>We are team Control Cycle, a consulting team within the actuarial division in one of Lumaria's biggest life insurance companies called SuperLife. In this project we have been tasked with providing a detailed report summarising our findings when constructing a robust health and wellness program. The final report is accessed [here](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/group-page-showcase-control-cycle-consulting/blob/main/Team%20Control%20Cycle%20Report.pdf). A summary of the report is provided below, however referring to the report will provide deeper insights into the conclusions drawn throughout the creation of SuperLife's health and wellness plan.

>Within the first few weeks of in the planning stages of our reporting and modelling, our team created a project outline that was adhered to throughout the completion of this project, and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/group-page-showcase-control-cycle-consulting/blob/main/Project%20Outline.pdf).

>The main model used to project the cash flows of the newly implemented wellness program and any sensitivity analysis conducted can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/group-page-showcase-control-cycle-consulting/blob/main/Projection%20of%20Cash%20Flows.xlsm). The additional files provided are supplementary and certain excel spreadsheets provide an indication of background calculations used to create some of the tabs in the main model excel spreadsheet. 

# Report Overview
**1 Objectives**

The provided wellness plan is aimed to incentivise Lumarian citizens to adopt healthier lifestyles to reduce mortality and increase life insurance sales based on the popularity of the proposed incentives. Once the products are made publicly available, monitoring at regular intervals (see Program Design) is required to assess the effectiveness of the program, mitigate any rise in risks, and make updates for any changes needed. The specific objectives are as follows:
1. Reduce expected mortality
2. Incentivise healthier behaviours
3. Increase insurance sales
4. Increase SuperLife's economic value
5. Improve marketability and competitiveness

_1.1 Key Performance Metrics_

A combination of long-term (reported biennially) and short-term metrics (reported quarterly) will be used to test the viability of the product. Metrics include:
1. New business participation rate (short-term)
2. Retention participation rate (short-term)
3. Satisfaction surveys (short-term)
4. Claim severity and frequency (short-term)
5. Financial viability (long-term)
6. Scalability and replicability (long-term)

**2 Program Design**

The most prevalent causes of death were identified as neoplasms (C00-D48) and cardiovascular diseases (I00-I99) (ICD-10, 2019). Consequently, the two health incentives drawn up are aimed to significantly prevent and reduce the occurrence of these ailments. The two final products target all age groups and individuals from both rural and urban households, and are as follows:

_2.1 Cardio Improvement App Package_

Combination of 2 apps targeted towards individuals aged 25-35, and are created with respective goals of reducing heart failure and heart disease through screenings and weight management programs, while also targeting an individual’s fitness via tracking and weight loss regimes. 

_2.2 Cancer Prevention Package_

Package consisting of several health screening initiatives targeted towards those aged 45 and the aim of the tests is to detect any abnormalities in the human body and if cancerous tissues are detected, they can be prevented from spreading.

_2.3 Marketing Strategy_

Our wellness program has been designed under an acquisition marketing strategy and was supported by creating market personas to better understand SuperLife’s customer base and target the right audience. 

_2.4 Timeframes for Program Evaluation_
